        Welcome to the World of Henok Aklilu!
        Where wires meet code, sparks of innovation fly.
        
        My name is Henok Aklilu, and I'm an unconventional force in the world of technology. By day, I'm a seasoned electrician at the Ethiopian Electric Utility Company, where I channel my hands-on skills into keeping the lights on for countless communities. By night, I transform into a full-stack developer, weaving lines of code to build engaging web experiences.
        
        What might seem like two separate worlds are, for me, two sides of the same coin. In both fields, I find the thrill of problem-solving, the satisfaction of building something tangible, and the joy of seeing my work touch lives.
        
        The Electrician:
        
        For over five years, I've traversed the Ethiopian landscape, climbing poles, diagnosing circuits, and ensuring the smooth flow of electricity. From intricate wiring in urban centers to remote villages powered by solar grids, I've tackled it all. My calloused hands and sharp mind are testaments to my dedication and expertise.
        
        The Full-Stack Developer:
        
        But when the sun sets, a different passion ignites. My fingers dance across the keyboard, conjuring websites from pixels and data. I'm equally at home in the front-end playgrounds of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as I am exploring the back-end labyrinths of Python and Node.js. My portfolio speaks volumes, showcasing diverse projects from sleek eCommerce platforms to interactive games.
        
        Why This Website?
        
        This space is not just a resume, but a bridge between my dual identities. It's where I showcase my electrical prowess through case studies and technical discussions. It's where I unveil my coding creations - websites, apps, and more. It's where I connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, potential employers, and anyone curious about the journey of an electrician who codes.

        And, of course, if you have a project that needs both wires and code, well, you know who to call!
        Remember, the world needs more individuals who can build circuits and build websites, diagnose electrical faults and debug code errors. I'm proof that both skillsets can coexist, and together, they can spark something truly remarkable.
